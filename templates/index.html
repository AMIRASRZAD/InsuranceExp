        <h1>Medical Cost Estimation Study</h1>
        <p>Thank you for participating in our research to estimate medical costs!</p>
        <h2>About the Study</h2>
        <p>Imagine that you are a medical insurance employee and you need to estimate medical costs (the expenses for healthcare services incured by Insured Customers) based on the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>BMI (Body Mass Index)</li>
            <li>Smoker Status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will first see a few examples to help you understand how medical costs relate to insured customer information. Then, you will complete six practice tasks to improve your accuracy, followed by six main tasks.</p>
        <p>Your performance will be measured by how many times your estimate is as good as or better than the automated algorithmâ€™s prediction. Pay close attention to the information provided in the practice tasks and during the main tasks to improve your estimates.</p>
        <p>Please note that there are a few attention check questions included in the study to ensure data quality. Make sure to read each question carefully.</p>
