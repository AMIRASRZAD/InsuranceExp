        <h1>Medical Cost Estimation Study</h1>
        <p>Thank you for participating in our research to estimate medical costs!</p>
        <h2>About the Study</h2>
        <p>Imagine that you are a medical insurance employee and you need to estimate medical costs (the expenses for healthcare services patients incur) based on the following patient information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Sex</li>
            <li>BMI (Body Mass Index)</li>
            <li>Smoker Status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are five practice tasks to help you get accurate estimates, followed by eight main tasks.</p>
        <p>Your performance will be measured by how many times (out of the 8 main tasks) your estimate is as good as or better than the AI’s prediction. Pay close attention to the information provided in the practice tasks and during the main tasks to improve your estimates.</p>
        <h2>Time</h2>
        <p>~10–15 minutes</p>
