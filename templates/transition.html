        <p>Great job completing the six practice tasks! Now, let’s dive into the main study to estimate medical costs with automated algorithm insights. Your performance will be measured by how many times (out of the 6 main tasks) your estimate is as good as or better than the automated algorithm’s prediction. Pay close attention to the information provided during the main tasks to improve your estimates.</p>
